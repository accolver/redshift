# Redshift

> Redshift is a decentralized, censorship-resistant secret management platform built on the Nostr protocol. It provides a Doppler-compatible CLI for managing environment variables and secrets with client-side encryption.

Important notes:

- Redshift uses Nostr (NIP-78 application-specific data) for storing encrypted secrets across distributed relays
- Secrets are encrypted client-side before being published - the server/relays never see plaintext
- Authentication uses Nostr keys (nsec/npub) via NIP-07 browser extensions or direct key entry
- The CLI is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Doppler's workflow (`redshift run`, `redshift secrets`)

- [Documentation](https://redshiftapp.com/docs): CLI commands reference, installation, and environment variables
- [Tutorial](https://redshiftapp.com/tutorial): Step-by-step getting started guide covering installation, authentication, project setup, and secret management

## CLI Commands

- `redshift login`: Authenticate with Nostr identity (supports --nsec, --bunker, or NIP-07)
- `redshift setup`: Configure project and environment for current directory (creates redshift.yaml)
- `redshift run -- <command>`: Run a command with secrets injected as environment variables
- `redshift secrets list`: List all secrets in current project/environment
- `redshift secrets set <KEY> <VALUE>`: Set a secret value
- `redshift secrets get <KEY>`: Get a specific secret value
- `redshift secrets delete <KEY>`: Delete a secret
- `redshift serve`: Start the local web admin UI

## Installation

```bash
# Install via script
curl -fsSL https://redshiftapp.com/install | sh

# Or with bun
bun add -g redshift
```

## Configuration

Redshift uses a `redshift.yaml` file in your project root:

```yaml
project: my-app
environment: development
```

Environment variables for CI/CD:
- `REDSHIFT_NSEC`: Private key for authentication
- `REDSHIFT_BUNKER`: Bunker URL for remote signing (NIP-46)
- `REDSHIFT_CONFIG_DIR`: Override config directory (default: ~/.redshift)

- [Nostr Protocol](https://nostr.com): Background on the Nostr protocol that Redshift is built on
